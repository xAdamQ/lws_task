How To Use
----------

1. Add the procjam16paperdolls/people/wireframe prefab to your scene

2. Drag in one of paperdolls/people/paperdolls-*.asset files to the Body Parts slot of your wireframe instance.

There's one for all body parts, one for male-only, one for female, and one for swimwear.

3. The doll will populate when the game starts, or you can call Pick() on the wireframe's BodyPicker script
