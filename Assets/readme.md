## overview
I use 2d navmesh plugin from github for player movement.
The shop is demo shows dummy items.
GameData saves and loads it’s fields by serialization.
The rest is pretty clear.

The task needs outfit changing and this can happen by one of 2 ways:
different sprites with full poses for animation
body parts like paper doll character, replacing the body parts, keeping the animation (whatever the used system)
I didn’t implement neither because I didin’t find artwork for this.

I didn’t make an invitory system also because there’re plenty of assets for this out there for that.

The chcarcter anim can be better.

## And here is the point:
    The task doesn’t have technical challenges, it’s only a lot of work for an unpaid evaluation task, and this frustrating because the effort would be useless if I didn’t, get accepted, so yesterday I decided not to do it, but I changed my mind today.
    I have some personal projects to share the source code with you, this could be a better way., I hope I make it to the interview phase.

# Thank you.
